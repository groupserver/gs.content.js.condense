Introduction
============

This module contains some `browser resources`_ for the Condense jQuery plugin. 
It was originally developed for GroupServer_ (hence the ``gs.``
name-space). However, it is completely devoid of anything that is specific
to GroupServer: any Zope_ or Plone_ project should be able to make use of
this egg.

`The original`_ code by Joe Sillitoe is available on GitHub. The
``README.markdown`` and license files are in the ``doc/`` directory of this
product.
